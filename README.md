# Talk-in-French-with-ChatGPT


This Git repository contains a Python script for interacting in French with ChatGPT, based on GPT4.

The assistant operates using voice commands, recording and transcribing user speech. It then utilizes the OpenAI API to generate relevant responses in French. Conversational exchanges are stored to provide context to the model, ensuring smooth and natural interactions. 

Note: Users are advised to securely handle their API keys and not to expose them directly in the code.
